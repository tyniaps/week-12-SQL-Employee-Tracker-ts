# week-12-SQL-Employee-Tracker-ts

Introduction to Structured Query Language.

## Description

The Employee Tracker was created as an introduction to SQL. 

Completing this challenge allowed for exploration of the ways in which SQL can be used to store and process information<br>
within relational databases.

The challenge also allowed for an understanding of how developers can utilise SQL to create interfaces for the use of non-developers.<br>
In comparison to other back-end concepts, the SQL language is effective in the way that it allows developers to see the databases from the users perspective, meaning that databases can be created in such a way that makes navigating them easy for the user. 

This command-line application allows for business owners to manage their business within a database. The application guides the user through a series of prompts which allow them to view and add new information to the database as needed.

## User Story

AS A business owner<br>
I WANT to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company<br>
